# Password-generator

About this project:

This project aims to create a password generator using an encryption key and link it to a database. The entries are stored locally. This project aims to diplay my python skills and also to provide me a motivation to learn more about cryptography. In the future I would also like to implement a hardware verification key, which uses a specific hardware key (need to decide on the microcontroller) to get access to the database.

Todo:

* Get the project properly setup in github with a proper modular structure.
* Integrate a database to store the passwords.
* Setup different branches for working on different features.
* Setup automatic unit testing.
* Setup a virtual environment using poetry.
* Try and use docker to further virtualize.
* Learn about a more sophisticated and secure encryption system and implement it.
* Work on design and implementation of a harware encryption key.
