# Password-generator

About this project:

This project aims to create a password generator using an encryption key and link it to a database. The entries are stored locally. This project aims to diplay my python skills and also to provide me a motivation to learn more about cryptography. In the future I would also like to implement a hardware verification key, which uses a specific hardware key (need to decide on the microcontroller) to get access to the database.

Todo:

* Integrate a database to store the passwords.
